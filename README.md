# Summary
As part of my computer science and game development studies I am making a prototype for a pokemon LIKE battler.
The code will be written in rust using the macroquad framework.

_Note: This is a prototype and does not intend to be a full featured game._

# Scope
List of things I will need to implement for the prototype to be considered "complete":
- [ ] Atleast one playable level/area.
- [ ] World triggers (i.e battles, item pickup, etc)
- [ ] Battle system with different types
- [ ] Basic animations and tiles
- [ ] Save System
